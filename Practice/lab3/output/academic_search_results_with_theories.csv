bae0ddb32c61848ffbb817bca4e181e86befd3fc,New threat of culture wars? The religious roots of public opinion polarization on morality issues in Europe,Tadeas Cely,2025,2025-03-17,European Union Politics,1,Semantic Scholar,"Cultural polarization divides European public opinion on moral issues, from Italy’s refusal to register children of same-sex couples to abortion protests in Poland. These divisions stem from historical church-state conflicts in various religious cultures. This polarization is particularly strong in Catholic countries but less so in Protestant ones. Using data from 19 European democracies, I show a persistent gap between Catholic and Protestant countries. On the other hand, I show a limited effect of economic prosperity. Developed countries no longer lead in moral issue divisions, with recent surveys showing no or reversed differences. Younger generations are no less principled on moral issues in the Catholic contexts, with cohort differences in polarization even growing significantly between 2008 and 2017, highlighting the enduring impact of religious traditions among younger cohorts.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bae0ddb32c61848ffbb817bca4e181e86befd3fc,new threat of culture wars? the religious roots of public opinion polarization on morality issues in europe,"New threat of culture wars?

One reason why scholars disagree is because polarization has often been studied either using individual issue questions or using an overall measure of ideology (usually ideological constraint). Because these methods are problematic, I use a multidimensional approach to estimating ideology. Since scholars have disagreed on what issue domains are important for Americans, I use exploratory factor analysis to show that there are three major ones: economics, race, and morality. I then use a latent measurement model to construct ideal points on all three beginning in the year 1988 going through to 2016. Then I evaluate polarization both as an increase in dispersion and as a state of how bimodal the distribution is. Although I find increased dispersion on all the dimensions since 1988, the key finding of this study is that the level of polarization is dependent on the dimension–Americans are more polarized on race and morality in 2016 than they are on economics.

Individuals with higher trust in government favor regulation, while those with greater trust in AI companies and AI technologies are less inclined to support restrictions. Trust in government and perceived risks significantly predict preferences for both soft (e.g., slowing development) and strong (e.g., banning AI systems) regulatory interventions. These results highlight the importance of public opinion in AI governance. As AI capabilities advance, effective regulation will require balancing public concerns about risks with trust in institutions. This study provides a foundational empirical baseline for policymakers navigating AI governance and underscores the need for further research into public trust, risk perception, and regulatory strategies in the evolving AI landscape.",[],,False

This study lays the groundwork for a deeper comprehension of the social opinion formation process and the development of strategies to address real-world social issues. In essence, our research introduces a novel methodology for comprehending and dissecting the intricate dynamics of opinion formation within the realm of opinion dynamics. This theoretical framework, coupled with a numerical simulation-based approach, offers fresh insights that extend beyond the confines of opinion dynamics. It opens up new perspectives in the domains of social science, physics, and computational modeling, ultimately contributing to a more profound understanding of social opinion formation.",[],,False

We consider a modification of the recently proposed DeGroot-Friedkin (DF) model, in which the opinion formation process takes place on the same timescale as the reflected appraisal process; we call this new model the single-timescale DF model. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the equilibria and convergence properties of the model for the settings of irreducible and reducible influence networks. For the setting of irreducible influence networks, the single-timescale DF model has the same behavior as the original DF model, that is, it predicts among other things that the social power ranking among individuals is asymptotically equal to their centrality ranking, that social power tends to accumulate at the top of the centrality ranking hierarchy, and that an autocratic (resp., democratic) power structure arises when the centrality scores are maximally nonuniform (resp., uniform). For the setting of reducible influence networks, the single-timescale DF model behaves differently from the original DF model in two ways. First, an individual, who corresponds to a reducible node in a reducible influence network, can keep all social power in the single-timescale DF model if the initial condition does so, whereas its social power asymptotically vanishes in the original DF model. Second, when the associated network has multiple sinks, the two models behave very differently: the original DF model has a single globally-attractive equilibrium, whereas any partition of social power among the sinks is allowable at equilibrium in the single-timescale DF model.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.02452v1,opinion dynamics and social power evolution: a single-timescale model,"Opinion Dynamics and Social Power Evolution: A Single-Timescale Model.

This effect impacts the drift of the social welfare, until a terminal date decided by the public when she stops the contract and gives compensation to the consortium. Usually, the public can not observe the effort done by the consortium, leading to a principal agent's problem with moral hazard. We solve this optimal stochastic control with optimal stopping problem in this context of moral hazard. The public value function is characterized by the solution of an associated Hamilton Jacobi Bellman Variational Inequality. The public value function and the optimal effort and rent processes are computed numerically by using the Howard algorithm. In particular, the impact of the social welfare's volatility on the optimal contract is studied.","['Contractualism', 'Virtue Ethics']",Contractualism; Virtue Ethics,False

Despite the impact of these algorithms on daily life and society, little is known about their effect on information transfer and opinion formation. It is thus unclear to what extent algorithmic bias has a harmful influence on collective decision-making, such as a tendency to polarize debate. Here we introduce a general theoretical framework to systematically link models of opinion dynamics, social network structure, and content filtering. We showcase the flexibility of our framework by exploring a family of binary-state opinion dynamics models where information exchange lies in a spectrum from pairwise to group interactions. All models show an opinion polarization regime driven by algorithmic bias and modular network structure.

Individuals of modern societies share ideas and participate in collective processes within a pervasive, variable, and mostly hidden ecosystem of content filtering technologies that determine what information we see online. Despite the impact of these algorithms on daily life and society, little is known about their effect on information transfer and opinion formation. It is thus unclear to what extent algorithmic bias has a harmful influence on collective decision-making, such as a tendency to polarize debate. Here we introduce a general theoretical framework to systematically link models of opinion dynamics, social network structure, and content filtering. We showcase the flexibility of our framework by exploring a family of binary-state opinion dynamics models where information exchange lies in a spectrum from pairwise to group interactions. All models show an opinion polarization regime driven by algorithmic bias and modular network structure. The role of content filtering is, however, surprisingly nuanced; for pairwise interactions it leads to polarization, while for group interactions it promotes coexistence of opinions. This allows us to pinpoint which social interactions are robust against algorithmic bias, and which ones are susceptible to bias-enhanced opinion polarization.
